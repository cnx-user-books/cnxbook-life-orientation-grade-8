      <title>ARE YOU A WINNER?</title>

        <title>You are what you think or not?</title>
        <para id="id17542674">There is a well -known saying that vegetarians use when they are confronted by the run-of-the- mill carnivore: You are what you eat! Just think of the guilty feelings such a saying can cause when you sit there, poised with knife and fork, ready to strike at a juicy, underdone steak! Or a tender piece of veal...</para>
        <para id="id16071887">There is great truth in the saying: You become what you think you are. In other words, your thoughts often determine what is to become of you. If you see yourself as stupid, you would be too unmotivated or scared to try - and if you do not try - you cannot expect to achieve success. Your negative expectations become true, in other words. If someone tells you often enough that you are bad or ugly, you will start to believe it. It is even more dangerous if the voice that tells you such negative things is your own. Who can you believe, if you can't believe yourself? Can you see how dangerous such negative selfspeak can be? It is vital that you stop negative thoughts before they form a pattern which will make you less than you deserve to be. Substitute positive thoughts for negative thoughts.</para>
        <para id="id15517209">Well, I used a whole lot of words to say that your thoughts often determine your success. This is it in a nutshell: You have to think like a winner to be a winner.</para>

        <para id="id4523589">This means that a winner competes against him- or herself to achieve the best result he or she is capable of. If you are able to get 100% in a subject and you get only 70% (and there was no real reason for not getting 100%), you did not use your full potential. If you are able to get 50% and you do so, then you are a winner. If you do your own personal best, you are a winner. Do not give in to the temptation to become a "minimum" kind of person.</para>

If you are unhappy or ill, friends and family should rally round and help you through the difficult time. But - no one should carry the baggage of someone else all the time.

        <para id="id3447977">Your self-concept is often linked to specific situations, for example, the sport fields, the school, and your social life. If Bull is an outstanding athlete, but a poor scholar, he would feel positive towards sport and motivated to try his best. In school situations, however, Bull will have difficulty motivating himself or would rather not try than fail. The problem is, no matter what others try, Bull has to convince himself that he can do better at school before he will have more success.</para>
        <para id="id4369912">Your self-concept determines how hard you are going to try and how you handle success and failures.

        <para id="id19069155">Our society is an intensely competitive one, whether we like it or not. You will always find someone faster, stronger, cleverer, prettier or more charming than you. Therefore, you need to know how to lose or concede defeat in such a way that nobody loses respect for you in the process.</para>
        <para id="id14716496">The positive thing about competition is that it can motivate you to do your very best. The negative side is that you could become so focused on winning that the activity and the joy you find in it, become secondary to winning.</para>
        <para id="id16336538">For example, it is wonderful to be able to play a musical instrument really well. To be able to do it well, you have to practise. However, few of us are concert material and will lose our joy in playing the instrument if we have to practise for hours on end. It is the same with sport. If you play tennis, there will be times that you lose, even if you practise hard. It should not take away the joy of the game. A person should be realistic. If you do your best and you are having fun and enjoying it - what more can you ask for? Then you are a winner!</para>
